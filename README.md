# Coding Exercises

This repository contains my iterative appraoch to learning data structures and algorithms. Here I will include my solutions to common coding exercise packages, these solutions will include my thought process, approach and solution. The goal of this is not only to develop an intutive understanding of data structures and algorithms but also to become comfortable programming in c++. 

## Additional Notes

I will include some solutions containing the key word refined in the name of the file as these solutions will be new approaches to the problem after having taking a data structures and algorithms course. These solutions will contain an explanation as to why the proposed solution is better.
